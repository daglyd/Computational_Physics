Project 2 in FYS3150 - Computational Physics
--------------------------------------------

The c++ code with functions are included in the ./src directory, with a main program in the project_2 directory. 

Python code for producing plots are cointained in the ./python folder. 
./python contains a python file with two functions and two jupyter notebooks for producing plots. 

Build and run

On linux run the makefile with command: make all\n
This will compile, link and run the c++ program, make the directories for Data and Figures, install python dependencies and run two jupyter notebooks from the commandline producing the figures for the report.
